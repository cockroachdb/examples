# Ledger example

## Summary

Simulate a ledger and a certain type of workload against it.
A general ledger is a complete record of financial transactions over the life
of a bank (or other company).
The example here aims to model a bank in a more realistic setting than our
previous bank example(s) do, and tickles contention issues (causing complete
deadlock in the more contended modes) which will be interesting to investigate.

## Running

See the bank example.
The example may be run both against Postgres and Cockroach.
